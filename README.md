> This paper introduces the Constant Rate Issuance Sales Protocol, or CRISP, a pricing mechanism that aims to sell NFTs at a targeted rate over time. If we want to sell 100 NFTs per day but are on pace to sell only 10, CRISP will slowly decay the "buy it now" price. If we want to sell 100 NFTs per day but are on pace to sell 200, CRISP will rapidly increase the “buy it now” price with every new sell.
